# Discussion board

Prototype two different views

Your discussion app should allow anyone with the URL to view discussion posts but only logged in users can create new posts. Discussion forums have discussion ​threads​, which are made up of discussion ​posts.​

The first view you will need is the ​feed​: a list of discussion threads in date order (most recent first). Similar to the feed in Piazza, each thread in the feed should show the title of the thread and a snippet of the message text e.g. the first 120 characters. The date of the first post in the thread should also be displayed. All users should be able to see the feed whether they are logged in or not.

The second view you will need is the ​thread view​. When a user clicks on a thread in the feed, the thread view should show the full contents of all posts in the thread, including author usernames and any tags associated with the post (see below).

You may choose to show the two views on the same screen, like Piazza, or on separate screens.
You may also choose how to incorporate post creation functionality.

Functionality by user status
Users who are not logged​ in should have an option to login.
Logged in users​ should be able to:
- Create a new discussion thread
- Reply to an existing thread

Saving and retrieving discussion posts
Discussion posts, threads and account info will need to be saved to and retrieved from a hosted database.
